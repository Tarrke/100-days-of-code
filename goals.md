# My Goals

For this challenge I think it's better to have some goals to achieve, some things to look up when in the middle of 
the blank page situation. Hence I'll set here some of my goals for the challenge

1. [Done] Finish the [Markdowner](https://github.com/Tarrke/wxw-markdowner) for my ebooks, I need to read on the train daily  
  This is quite done throught Day 1. Did not think it would have been so fast to refactor my old script into something usable. I still have some minor work to do. I've quit finish all I wanted to do. Edited my first book with the new lib system, worked like charme. Everything will be easier in the future, I'm glad I did this. I'm marking this entry as done.
2. Work on a Factorio Mod called [Landmarks](https://github.com/Tarrke/factorio-landmarks), the empty shell is done
3. Take some freecodecamp courses for CSS and design mainly
4. Work on a phone app to design meals for the week  
  4.1 Polish my skills in JS, nodeJS in particular  
  4.2 Learn React Native  
  4.3 Do the App
