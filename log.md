# 100 Days Of Code - Log - [Tarrke]

## Day 0: June 29, Friday

**Taoday's Progress**: I've set up some goals for the challenge. I've also set up some tools, like this log, and of course the first enrty is a bit late.

**Thoughts**: I'm quite afraid of what I'll do tommorrow and the next day, and so on. Seeing the 100th day so far is quite disturbing. But I'll do it as I can.

So here is a little list of what I will do or won't:

1. Finish the Markdowner for my ebooks, I need to read on the train daily
2. Work on a Factorio Mod called Landmarks, the empty shell is done
3. Take some freecodecamp courses
4. Polish my skills in JS, nodeJS in particular
5. Learn React Native
6. Work on a phone app to design meals for the week

If I can do some of these, I'll be happy.

## Day 1: June 30, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

**Link(s) to work**:
