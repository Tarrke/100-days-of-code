# 100 Days Of Code - Log - [Tarrke]

## Day 0: June 29, Friday

**Taoday's Progress**: I've set up some goals for the challenge. I've also set up some tools, like this log, and of course the first enrty is a bit late.

**Thoughts**: I'm quite afraid of what I'll do tommorrow and the next day, and so on. Seeing the 100th day so far is quite disturbing. But I'll do it as I can.

So here is a little list of what I will do or won't:

1. Finish the Markdowner for my ebooks, I need to read on the train daily
2. Work on a Factorio Mod called Landmarks, the empty shell is done
3. Take some freecodecamp courses
4. Polish my skills in JS, nodeJS in particular
5. Learn React Native
6. Work on a phone app to design meals for the week

If I can do some of these, I'll be happy.

## Day 1: June 30, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through twitter API and did a script that will help me tweet about this challenge.  Hey my next tweets on this will be sent by a robot!

**Thoughts**: I'm pretty happy to have done that. I had to do some research and get argparse done the right way this time. Not quite sure about the import after the __name__ == "__main__" but will see that next time.

## Day 2: July 1, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:

* did some work with dates

**Thoughts**: Today was great but baby was too hot due to weather conditions. I spend lot of time with her and argued with wife about age calculation. In the end I decided to write a small script to get the baby's age calculated the right way. Next I wanted to do some work with APIs, and decided to go toward the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/). I've just scratched the surface though.

## Day 3: July 2, Monday

**Today's Progress**:

* worked on my factorio mod
  * created the base mod
  * set option to show log
  * set locale to option
* worked on the python script to deploy the mod

**Thoughts**: Today was not great at work. Got home feeling bad but coding get me fells better. I did some lua work but spend most of my time working with files and copy in python. Get the things I wanted, so all in all I'm satisfied with today's work

## Day 4: July 3, Monday

**Today's Progress**:

* worked on my factorio mod
  * added entity Eiffel Tower, recipe and item

**Thoughts**: Still working my factorio modding skills. Got better today and I'm quite to the point where I can place a new object in game. Lot of work still needed for this item to work as intended though.

## Day 5: July 4, Monday

**Today's Progress**:

* worked on my factorio mod
  * made the entity fell wel in inventory
  * made the entity in the world
  * minor correction to the deployment script, still need a fix.

**Thoughts**: Still working my factorio modding skills. Did some progress with the data structure of the game and got better understanding of it. The next parts should be easier to go through.
