# 100 Days Of Code - Log - [Tarrke]

## Day 0: June 29, Friday

**Taoday's Progress**: I've set up some goals for the challenge. I've also set up some tools, like this log, and of course the first enrty is a bit late.

**Thoughts**: I'm quite afraid of what I'll do tommorrow and the next day, and so on. Seeing the 100th day so far is quite disturbing. But I'll do it as I can.

So here is a little list of what I will do or won't:

1. Finish the Markdowner for my ebooks, I need to read on the train daily
2. Work on a Factorio Mod called Landmarks, the empty shell is done
3. Take some freecodecamp courses
4. Polish my skills in JS, nodeJS in particular
5. Learn React Native
6. Work on a phone app to design meals for the week

If I can do some of these, I'll be happy.

## Day 1: June 30, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through twitter API and did a script that will help me tweet about this challenge.  Hey my next tweets on this will be sent by a robot!

**Thoughts**: I'm pretty happy to have done that. I had to do some research and get argparse done the right way this time. Not quite sure about the import after the __name__ == "__main__" but will see that next time.
